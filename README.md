Diagnose like a Radiologist: Attention Guided Convolutional Neural Network for Thorax Disease Classification
======
This is a reimplementation of paper :  Diagnose like a Radiologist: Attention Guided Convolutional Neural Network for Thorax Disease Classification (AG-CNN)

*Recently, the paper is accpeted in PRL 2020 with title "Thorax disease classification with attention guided convolutional neural network"*

In this repo, you can train & test your own models, more details are shown in the code.
